<h4>Claxton: Rattlesnake and Wildlife Festival</h4>
<p>
    Claxton's biggest and most well known annual event that draws people to the town is the Claxton Rattlenake
    Roundup, which is now known as the Claxton Rattlesnake and Wildlife Festival. People come from all over to see
    live snakes and to learn about them from professional snake handlers. Vendors come from all over to sell their wares
    in booths at the festival. You can buy just about anything you can think of that would be hand-made or
    otherwise produced in the USA. There are even games and activities for the kids, including a petting zoo. The
    non-snake animal exhibit is a newer addition to the traditional festival. This festival is usually held the
    second weekend in March.<br />
